# Heart Rate Monitoring Project

## Description

The Heart Track is a low-cost IoT-enabled web application designed for monitoring heart rate and blood oxygen 
saturation levels throughout the day at a user defined rate. The device uses a heart rate and oxygen sensor
to periodically remind users heart rate and blood oxygen saturation level mesurements, these measurements are then
transmitted to the Heart Track web appplication for users to view. The time of day and rate the measurements will be 
taken can be configured by the user. The web application uses a responsive desgin allowing for viewing on a desktop,
tablet, and mobile device.
